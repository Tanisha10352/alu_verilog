# Enhanced ALU with cocotb Verification

## ðŸ”§ Overview
This project implements a 16-bit signed Enhanced Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog. It supports multiple operations including:
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR

The ALU is tested using the **cocotb** Python-based verification framework and visualized using **GTKWave**.
